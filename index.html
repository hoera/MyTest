<br>These web pages were developed to facilitate learning a cycling method used by William Bengston, PhD.<br>
<br>Each will show each image for 1 second, then increase the speed of change until the images blur, depending on your computer speed.<br>
<br>The first link is the <a href="flipcard.html" >flipcard</a> method. This one includes clicking sounds with each change in image. You might have to give your browser permission to hear the sounds.
<br><br>
The second link is the <a href="clock.html" >clock</a> method, mentioned on William Bengston's CD Course.
<br><br>
Third link is to the <a href="infinity.html">infinity</a> method, it places the images in a pattern that you will follow with your eyes keeping your head steady. This is a sort of combination cycling and QiGong for the eyes.
<br><br>
Fourth link is to the <a href="pendulum.html">pendulum</a> method, it places the images in a pattern that you will follow with your eyes keeping your head steady. This is a sort of combination cycling and Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).

<h3>You can also run a customized version of this program on your pc or laptop, no web server required.</h3>
Simply download <a href="cycle.zip">this file</a> and unzip it in any directory on your
pc or laptop. It will create a sub-directory called /cycle/. In this subdirectory you will
find jpg files named "1_cycle.jpg", "2_cycle.jpg", etc. Replace these with your own image files,
but keep the names "1_cycle.jpg", "2_cycle.jpg", etc. You can rename your image files "1_cycle.jpg", "2_cycle.jpg", etc.
It's helpful to have all the image files approximately the same size. Then open up the file called "flipcard.html"
with any text editor like Notepad. In this file you can customize the number of images you want up to 40,
the starting speed, the rate of speed increase, and the final speed. The file is annotated to show you
exactly where it make the changes. To run the program just double-click on flipcard.html and it will
open up in your browser.
